--Rasha & Maya--

--Firas & Rasha--
Firas: How is she?

Rasha: She's doing okay. A little hungry and thirsty.

Firas: I just hope we can make it out safely. 

--Firas & Rasha--
Firas: I'm worried about you.

Rasha: Every day just gets harder.

Firas: A shower would be nice.

Rasha: I wouldn't mind a massage, maybe a foot-rub.

--Zada & Sami--

Sami: What's the first thing you'll do when we settle down?

Zada: Probably take a nap. It's been a while.

Zada: You?

Sami: Eat a burger or a pizza. Something concentrated in carbs.

--Firas & Zada--
//Standoff about what they're gonna do when they settle down?
Firas: So, what will you do when we settle down?

Zada: I don't know, probably lay in bed for a few weeks

Firas: You can't be serious...

Zada: I'm not. I'll probably settle for a house and decide where to go from there

Firas: You should probably look for work. 

Zada: Thanks {i}dad{/i} I didn't think of that.
